# Logbook

A command-line application for tracking your computer usage
times. It is currently under development.

## Installation

You can find a development release of *The Digital Logbook* as a crate
on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/digital-logbook). Assuming you
have `cargo` installed, run this command to compile the code from
source and install the binary:

```shell
cargo install digital-logbook
```

Make sure to add the installation directory to `PATH`, as `cargo`
suggests. The installed binary is called `logbook`. Have fun!
